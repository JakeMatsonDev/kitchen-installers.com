      "IKEA kitchen cabinets offer exceptional value, but assembling them correctly requires experience and the right tools. Our team specializes exclusively in IKEA cabinet systems, so we know every cam lock, dowel, and rail by heart. Whether you have a compact galley kitchen with ten cabinets or a sprawling open-plan layout with forty, we deliver consistent, factory-quality results every time.",
      "We work with the full SEKTION lineup — base cabinets, wall cabinets, high cabinets, and corner units — as well as older AKURUM frames for renovation projects. Each cabinet is squared, leveled, and secured to the wall with appropriate hardware for your wall type, whether it is drywall over studs, concrete, or masonry. We also install all interior fittings including shelves, drawer runners, hinges, and soft-close dampers.",
      "Proper assembly directly affects the longevity of your kitchen. A cabinet that is even slightly out of square can cause doors to misalign, drawers to bind, and countertops to sit unevenly. Our installers use laser levels and precision shims to ensure every unit is plumb and true before we move on to doors and drawer fronts.",

    longDescription: [
      "The gap between the top of wall cabinets and the ceiling is one of the most common eyesores in a kitchen renovation. It collects dust, looks unfinished, and wastes space. A well-constructed bulkhead eliminates all three problems, giving your kitchen the polished, custom look of a high-end installation at a fraction of the cost.",
      "Our bulkheads are framed with lightweight steel or timber, depending on your ceiling structure and local building requirements. The frame is securely anchored to ceiling joists and wall studs, then clad in moisture-resistant plasterboard. All joints are taped, mudded, and sanded smooth so the finished bulkhead blends seamlessly with your ceiling.",
      "Bulkheads serve a practical purpose beyond aesthetics. They provide a concealed channel for range hood ducting and LED lighting strips. If you need wiring or plumbing routed through the bulkhead, your electrician or plumber should complete that work before we close it up.",
      "We build bulkheads in various profiles to match your kitchen design. A standard box bulkhead sits flush with the front of your wall cabinets. A stepped bulkhead extends past the cabinet face to create a shadow line or accommodate recessed lighting. An angled bulkhead follows a sloped ceiling line for attic or loft kitchens.",
      "Every bulkhead we build is finished to a paint-ready or paint-complete standard. We can match your existing ceiling texture or deliver a smooth finish ready for your painter. If you want integrated LED strip lighting along the bottom edge, we install the channel — your electrician handles the final connection."
