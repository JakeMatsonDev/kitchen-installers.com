    introContent: "Freeport's South Shore location and nautical character make it a unique Long Island community, and its kitchens deserve to reflect that personality. The Nautical Mile district draws visitors from across the region, while the residential neighborhoods feature a charming mix of Cape Cods, bungalows, and colonials that benefit tremendously from IKEA kitchen upgrades. Many Freeport kitchens were designed in the 1940s through 1960s, when open layouts and maximum storage were not priorities. IKEA's modern cabinet systems change that equation entirely, offering full-height pantry cabinets, deep drawers, and clever organizers that triple your usable storage space. The IKEA Brooklyn store is a reasonable drive west along the Belt Parkway, and IKEA delivery reaches Freeport easily. Our installation team appreciates the specific considerations of South Shore homes, including moisture management in kitchens close to sea level and the occasional need for extra waterproofing behind sink areas. We bring precision and care to every Freeport kitchen installation, ensuring your IKEA cabinets are level, plumb, and built to last.",
